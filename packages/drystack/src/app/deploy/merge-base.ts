// Resolves the real merge base of a brand branch and the default branch, by
// asking git (via GitHub's compare API) instead of remembering it.
//
// A brand used to carry the base it was cut from in its IndexedDB record. That
// worked only as long as the record survived; whenever it didn't (new browser,
// cleared storage, a branch adopted from a URL), the brand guard rebuilt the
// record with `base = default branch HEAD *today*`. Deploy then merged with
// base === theirs, which makes classifyChanges read every commit main gained
// since the brand was cut as "ours deleted/reverted it" — and the deploy commit
// silently rolled main back to the brand's tree. The base is not something we
// get to guess: it's a fact about the two refs, so we look it up every deploy.
//
// Callers pass commit SHAs (not branch names) so refs containing `/` — every
// brand ref does — need no path escaping.
